# TodoBoard Website

## Overview
This is my first fullstack project. I finished learning backend concepts and wanted to practice them by creating a Todo List Website.

## Functionality
The website is made up of a todo list that divides your todos into two categories: "To Do" and "Done". You can check a task to add it to the "Done" category or uncheck it to add it to the "To Do" one. You can also edit and delete each task. There's a folder tab that allows you to create custom folders and switch between them. This option is only available while logged in. If not logged in, the todos get saved in localStorage.
